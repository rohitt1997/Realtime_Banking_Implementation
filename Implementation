The Real-Time Architecture
To demonstrate "Real-Time," you must simulate three distinct layers: the Generator (The Bank), the Processor (Your Engine), and the Observer (The Dashboard).

A. The Data Generator (Simulating the Bank)
Instead of loading the whole CSV, write a script that "drips" data into your system.

Action: Create a script that reads PaySim and sends 5–10 transactions per second to a FastAPI endpoint or a Kafka topic.

Why: This proves your system can handle continuous ingestion without crashing.

B. The "In-Memory" Feature Store
In real-time, you can't query a slow SQL database for every transaction.

Action: Use Redis or a simple Python dictionary to store the last 5,000 transactions.

Logic: Every time a new transaction arrives, append it to your "Current Window" and drop the oldest one from the "Reference Window."

2. Visualizing Drift (The "Analyst View")
To show the project effectively, you need a front-end. Use Streamlit (easiest for Python) or Grafana.

The Dashboard should display:
Drift Gauge: A needle moving in real-time showing the current Jensen-Shannon Distance.

Traffic Light System: * 🟢 Green: Stable distribution.

🟡 Yellow: Minor drift (behavioral shift detected).

🔴 Red: Critical drift (possible new fraud attack).

The "Suspect" Feed: A scrolling table of transactions flagged as fraud by your engine.
Practical Demo Script
If you are presenting this, follow this flow to show the "Real-Time" value:
Step,Action,What the Audience Sees
1. Baseline,"Start the generator with ""Normal"" transactions.",Dashboard is green; Drift score is near 0.0.
2. The Attack,"Inject ""High Amount"" or ""Transfer"" heavy data.",The JS-Distance spike! The gauge turns red.
3. Detection,The Engine flags the new transactions.,"The ""Suspect Feed"" populates with the injected data."
4. Resolution,The Engine updates its reference window.,"The system ""learns"" the new normal and stabilizes."


4. Tools to Use
Component,Tool Recommendation
Dashboard,Streamlit (Live updates with st.empty() or st.dataframe)
Database,SQLite (Easy to set up) or InfluxDB (Built for time-series)
Processing,FastAPI (To receive transaction data via JSON)
Visuals,"Plotly (For interactive, real-time charts)"
